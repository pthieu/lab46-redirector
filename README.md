# Setup

## Node
Set up your `.env` based on `.env.example` then:

```
pnpm i
pnpm migrate:generate
pnpm dev
```

# Debugging

## VSCode
Debug with this `launch.json`
```
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "command": "pnpm dev",
      "name": "Debug",
      "request": "launch",
      "type": "node-terminal"
    }
  ]
}
```

## CLI
TBD

# Details

## Database

We're using [Drizzle ORM](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm) because they're a lightweight wrapper on top of SQL. They abstract away a lot of boilerplate connecting Typescript to SQL without getting in your way and they don't compromise on technical decisions by trying to support other languages (unlike a certain other popular ORM).

### Migrations

The thing about Schema-first Typescript ORMs is that most of them require the migrations to happen at the application level to reduce risks associate d with schema drift (time between the DB schema changing and application code chainging) and because the library doesn't know your compilation strategy. You can probably pull it out into its own `.ts` script and import the `config`, but the build steps will have to change a bit.

Specific to Drizzle though, we need to commit the `meta` metadata folder. They haven't documented why but they've confirmed to do this on Discord. In a multi-dev project, you can run the `pnpm migrate:check` command to see if your migrations are in sync.

On build, ESBuild will copy migrations over to the output folder at `./migrations`. The `~/db/index.ts` is set up to look for a migrations folder at `__dirname/migrations`, so for both local dev and production, it will work. If you move the `migrationToLatest` function somwehere else or decide to modify the migration folder path, you'll also need to modify the copy path in `esbuild.mjs`.

I have yet to confirm, but Drizzle *should* have a lock at the DB level on a migration, so multiple instances of the services shouldn't conflict.


# Deployment

## Docker
Set up your `.env` based on `.env.example`, you'll have to use `host.docker.internal` for the DB host instead of `localhost`, then:

```
docker build -t ts-api .
docker-compose up -d
```

If the docker container spins up, you're good and you can use whatever deployment mechanism you want.
